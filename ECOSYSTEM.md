# The Incremental DOM Ecosystem

The page contains a list of tools and libraries that use or can be used with Incremental DOM. If you have something that you have worked on and would like to share, please feel free to send us a pull request to add it here.

## Templating Languages

### Closure Compiler Templates

We are building a new JavaScript backend for the
[Closure Templates](https://developers.google.com/closure/templates/) templating
language. Follow along on [Github](https://github.com/google/closure-templates/).

```
{template .helloWorld}
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
{/template}
```

### JSX

You can also use React's [JSX syntax](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) using this
[Babel plugin](https://github.com/babel-plugins/babel-plugin-incremental-dom).

```js
function render() {
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>
}
```

### superviews.js

[superviews.js](https://github.com/davidjamesstone/superviews.js) is a template language that closely maps to the incremental-dom API.

```html
<p if="showMe" class="{=cssClass}">
  <span style="{ color: foo, width: bar }">{name}</span>
</p>
```

### starplate

[starplate](https://github.com/littlstar/starplate) is a fast template and view engine built on top of the incremental-dom API. It makes use of ES6 template strings for interpolation, [parse5](https://github.com/inikulin/parse5) for DOM travserval, and incremental-dom for DOM patches.

Consider the following rudimentary example for rendering and updating a clock.

```js
import {View} from 'starplate';
const clock = new View('<section>Time <span class="time">${time}</span></section>')
clock.render(document.body);
setInterval(_ => clock.update({time: Date()}, 1000);
```

### jsonml2idom

[jsonml2idom](https://github.com/paolocaminiti/jsonml2idom) - JSONML to Incremental DOM interpreter.
```js
function app(state) {
  return ['h1', 'Hello World!']
}

IncrementalDOM.patch(root, jsonml2idom, app(state))
```

### Create your own

If you work on a templating language we'd love to see Incremental DOM adopted as
an alternative backend for it. This isnâ€™t easy, we are still working on ours and
will for a while, but we're super happy to help with it.

Here's an [example](https://gist.github.com/sparhami/197f3b947712998639eb).
